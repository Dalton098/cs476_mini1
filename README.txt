1 -	Dalton Rothenberger

2 -	Approximately 3 hours. I was struggling with understanding dot product and cross product for a while
 	so a majority of the time was spent understanding those before I started coding.

3 -	I liked the assignment. It felt like it was easing me back into vectors (which I haven't seen in a 
	year) and seeing the graphical representations of what I was doing was pretty cool.
